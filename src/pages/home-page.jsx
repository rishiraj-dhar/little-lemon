              <p>
                Our journey began with a shared passion for traditional
                Mediterranean cuisine and a dream to bring those authentic
                flavors to our community.

                Mario and Adrian are the heart and soul behind Little Lemon.
                Growing up in a family where food was the center of every
                gathering, they developed a deep love for cooking and a keen
                sense for flavors. Inspired by their heritage and driven by
                their dream, they decided to open Little Lemon, a place where
                tradition meets innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mario, with his extensive culinary experience, brings a modern
                twist to the traditional recipes passed down from their
                grandparents. Adrian, with his impeccable sense of taste and
                presentation, ensures that every dish not only tastes amazing
                but looks beautiful as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Little Lemon, we believe that food is more than just
                sustenance; it&apos;s an experience that brings people together.
                Our mission is to create a warm, welcoming environment where our
                guests can enjoy the rich, diverse flavors of the Mediterranean,
                made with the freshest ingredients and a lot of love.
              </p>
